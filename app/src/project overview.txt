Project Overview (Nido)
I'm developing a game with Android Studio, Kotlin, and Jetpack Compose.

Project Architecture Note:
Currently, the ViewModel class is mostly an empty shell and is present only for historical or structural reasons.
All game state and business logic is managed by GameManager, which acts as the single source of truth.
The ViewModel may be further developed or integrated in future phases, but as of now, all state mutations and game flow are centralized within GameManager.
