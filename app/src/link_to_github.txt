In order to access the files of the Nido project in GitHub, use the following rule 


# Nido Project – GitHub Connector Access Rules for ChatGPT

- The GitHub Connector is enabled in ChatGPT Web (https://chat.openai.com) with access granted to the `fwillem/Nido` repository.
- All prompts and code/file requests should be made from the **Web version** of ChatGPT, not the Desktop app (since the Desktop app does not yet support connectors).
- **Do not use raw.githubusercontent.com URLs** for file access: ChatGPT should use the GitHub Connector.

## File paths and navigation

- To request a file, simply specify its relative path from the root of the repository (e.g., `app/src/main/java/com/example/nido/NidoApp.kt`).
- The project tree generated by `tree /F /A > project_tree.txt` is optional and can be used for overall project structure reference, but is no longer required for file navigation—ChatGPT can directly access any file by path using the connector.

## Limitations and recommendations

- The GitHub Connector does **not** guarantee instant/live access to the very latest commit. Changes may take **5–30 minutes (or longer)** to become visible to ChatGPT.
- There is **no way for the user to force an immediate refresh** of the index or connector view.
- If you notice a delay or outdated content, you should:
    - Wait and re-try your request after 5–10 minutes,
    - **Or, for urgent analysis, upload or paste the file content directly into ChatGPT.**
- If you encounter an error (e.g., 503 "browse unavailable"), wait and try again later. Manual upload/paste remains a reliable fallback.

## Security

- The connector only has access to repositories explicitly authorized during setup (here, `fwillem/Nido`).
- No other repositories or files are visible to ChatGPT.

---

**Workflow summary:**
1. Specify the path of the file you want to read/modify (e.g., `app/src/main/java/com/example/nido/NidoApp.kt`).
2. If changes are not reflected immediately, wait or upload the file directly.
3. Raw links and tree files are no longer required for navigation; the Web app connector is now the reference.
